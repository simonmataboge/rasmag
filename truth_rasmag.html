            <p>Lion is the KING of the jungle, He eats nothing but meat so how come this LION also represent nation that doesn’t promote meat eating? How come some say Haile Selassie I eat meat. When I read BIBLE as I was told everything is in the BIBLE, God gave Noah authority to eat all his animals and there are several verses that promote eating meat, even in Ethiopia there are some stories of meat eaters, I want to know and understand is. What is the significant meaning of eating meat and not eating?<br>
            <b>This reality of Ital Living consist of three main food sources of whole grain, vegetables and fruits. We reject meat as food because of the negative impacts it produces</b>

            <div class="stanza">

            <p>Our creator has given us the green herbs for meat’’He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man’
            From all this, we all know that almighty does not delight in the so called flesh of animals or meat. In the beginning man was ‘’herbaterian not murderer of animals or men to fill his belly. Ital means total or food which promote harmony within mind, body and soul. These food consist mainly of herbs, fruits and whole grain (Brain food).				THE LION OF JUDAH REPRESENTING KING SOLOMON 
            Do a little experiment to prove if what I’m saying is false or true. Put two tomatoes in hot water, one from the shop and other one from the backyard garden then observe the results. The home grown is small and almost half cooked in the water while the big fresh crispy one still need lot of cooking before you can eat it. Remember too much cooking kills all the nutrients from the source

                In my years of Rastafari captivated under the alien ruler called Babylon. I’ve never met such a glorious phenomenal beautiful woman like this woman, she’s divine and she deserve to be called empress due to her works in the eyes of the world of the working class. She is the face that is in the center of her working site. She maintain her principles despite all the trials and tribulations she faces on daily basis, temptations brought by her colleagues, all the friendly smiles and big wallets that she experience on daily basis, the whole trust she earned by being loyal in the management department, never tempt her to do evil

                Most woman can fall pregnant but not all will receive the pearl.The pearl is received by a woman who come out Babylon and separate themselves from vanities and insanities of this world.As the scriptures of YAH Rastafari as the Bible and Torah speaks of examples of righteous mothers…Makeda(Queen of Sheba) Shara(Mother of Isaac) Maryam(Mother of Jes-us)These are ‘GOOD WOMAN’womb-men of light and righteousness who made Love offering of themselves unto their Sustainer YAH.Ras Tafari means SELF-RESPECT which means as a daughter of Zion,you have to change your manner of living,the way you dress,what you do and why you doing it.Yah Rastafari
                shall be your Sustainer and His words will come first.

                 your natural woolly hair.You can’t continueto kill(abort) by
                 using contraceptives or any method.

                HOW HARD IT IS TO FIND CAPABLE WIFE.SHE IS WORTH

                IN HER AND HE WILL NEVER BE POOR AS LONG AS SHE LIVES
                SHE DOES HIM GOOD AND NEVER HARM.SHE BRINGS HOME
                GOOD FOOD FROM OUT OF THE PLACES,AS MERCHANT SHIPS  
                DO.SHE LOOKS AT THE LAND AND BUYS IT,AND WITH MONEY

                The name EVE sounds like EVIL as most would say>This was a name used by the Babylonian Serpent people known as Canaanites to down press Ethiopian queens in order to control the Ethiopian kings.The real name of Eve was Hewan or Heywan meaning LIFE.Heywan was to became ‘’Mother of All Living’’She was one of the green people known as bush people who lived along the water source of the Nile known as Lake Tana in Ethiopia(Ether Utopia)

            <p>
                Due to ignorance, propaganda and lack of knowledge, most Africans feel like Rastafari originate from Kingston Jamaica but if we look at biblical, historical and biologically reasoning, we realise that in the 21st century Jamaica is a result of Christopher Columbus and all His associates.
                When you meet Rastaman or Rastawoman along the way, the first thing you think of is Jamaica. When you meet someone smoking ganja or wearing red, green and gold with long hair, first thing that comes to mind is ‘’His Rasta’’ is He really Rasta or someone trying to hide his weaknesses and laziness? Is Rastafari a vow of poverty or vow of being coward and lazy? This article will show you </p>
             </div>
            <div class="stanza">            
               <p> During slavery days, Africans were taking to different parts of Europe. Some did enjoy being slaves but most found a way to run away, since Africa was too far, they saw this lovely and natural island and they decided to call it home or Xhamaika soon called Jamaica. They had to hide and destroy their identity, customs, culture so that Christopher won’t come and claim them as his people, they were forced to change their languages Xhosa and English to something unique, something that white man won’t recognise. If you listen to Rastafari Patwa, you will realise that it is a combination of African languages

            <p>
                When we look at the word Rasta [Righteous African Stand Tall Alone].When we look at Rastafari, likes of Bob Marley. To be Rasta, you got to be African but to be Rastafari, you don’t need a certain colour or race, you got to keep teachings of King Solomon that was 
                Passed to Menelik who was later known as David the 2nd and then it was passed to Ras Tafari, who is known as Haile Selassie I the 1st.Rastafari is about vow of Nazareth, vow written in every Rastafari heart and soul, something we will die for. Bob Marley and Ras 
                Mpho of tribe of Levi from little town called Brits [Bethan] passed flash keeping the vow of Nazareth strong and holy.
                To date we have different mansions of Rastafari but the mission is still the same, still practice the same creed, the only difference is regions and societies we were born under
