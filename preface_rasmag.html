            <p>
                In the name of Yah wrongfully called Jah Rastafari 
                The purpose of this work is to guide, educate, learn, unite, strengthen Rases local and abroad
                We are not here to oppose or hurt anyone, Rases, Non-Rases and Anti-Rases, We are all welcome to read, learn and leave a comment, where ever we a wrong, we will try by all means to deliver apology on the next issue
                Information was discovered from several books but mostly spiritual books and books about Ras Tafari 
                When you send us a comment or article, make sure you give us facts, we do not want opinions as if you are in the toilet or tarven.
			</p>

            <div class="stanza">
		<p>
				NO OFFENCE but this is about real issues affecting RASTAFARI so if you plan to make us look like clowns, I would advise you to play somewhere else not here  
                Our intentions is not to add or subtract anything from Rastafari living, We just want to highlight certain issues and bring them to light as We are the light of this world
                We are not here to tell you how to live your life, how to walk nor what to eat
                What we will surely do, is to embrace and provide teachings to those who understand and make them over stand, those who do not know, make them know
                Rastafari is often misunderstood and misrepresented in the western societies

				         </div>
            <div class="stanza">
				<p>
				Most communities know Christianity and Islam as the only religions but I-RASMAG is here to clarify the purpose of Rastaman and make Rastafari well known and respected as it has been written
                We interview and give Rases a platform to teach as we will reveal true stories about trials and tribulations we face on day to day basis.
                We write this booklet hoping that mases will start to realize that Rastafari is not opposing Christianity or any other religion and we hope you will join us in this mission especially in this day and time 
				If you call yourself Rasta then this booklet is made for you by you to you so that you can manifest what our forefathers have been trying to do all along but they could not take it further due to lack of resources and oppression
				</p>

            <div class="stanza">
				<p>					
                Today, We walk freely dreaded and some a dreaded even if they do not know the purpose of the crown as for some do not know what is meant when we call dread as vow or crown or why we never clown around since Rastafari was no clown, We are here to work not play and if you can’t work for Yah, remember that you are called Jahman, meaning man of God, We teach the word of God according to Ras Tafari. We preach gospel of Christ according to Haile Selassie so let’s respected and honor that
