            THERE WAS AN ANCIENT WINE THAT WAS USED MILLION YEARS AGO.YOU CANNOT OVERDOSE YOURSELF OR ACT INDICIENCY AFTER CONSUMING THIS WINE.THE WINE OF RASTAFARI IS CALLED MARIJUANA.THIS IS A NATURAL WEED PLANT THAT WAS DISCOVERED MILLION YEARS AGO IN MOUNTAINS OF CHINA,A TREE CALLED CANNABIS.THIS PLANT HAS A  CHEMICAL INGREDIENT CALLED THC[TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL] WHICH IS COMMONLY USED IN HARD DRUGS OR SUBSTANCES.

                  <p> THC PROTECT THE TREE FROM ULTRA VIOLET(SUN)AND IT GIVES THE TREE BAD TASTE SO IT CAN LIVE LONG AND NOT TO BE EATEN BY ANY KIND OF CONSUMERS
                   HOWEVER THIS TREE CAN LEAVE YOU STONED FOR SEVERAL HOURS DUE TO THIS CHEMICAL.WILD WEED THAT PRODUCES A BLESSFULL RELEASE BUT AS FOR SOME, IT WILL LEAVE YOU WITH HEADACHES, UNPLEASANT FEELING ESPECILLY WHEN YOU HAVE SEVERAL BACTERIA IN YOUR SYSTEM.THIS CHEMICAL PLAYS A VERY BIG ROLE IN THE STRUCTURE OF A HUMAN BEING, SMOKED OR COOKED, LET’S LEAVE THE LECTURES FOR THE NEXT COMING ISSUE OF I-RASMAG.</p>

            <p><b>IS THIS THE CANNABIS OR THE NEW WINE</b>
                Yes this is the wine that Rastaman teaches about. Rastaman doesn’t preach, we teach
                WOW CAN THIS TREE REALLY DO ALL THESE THINGS
                Yes this is the tree that bear its fruit in its season, it bears its fruit 12 months, throughout the year and it has 12 different uses, Biologically, Physically, Emotionally, Historically
                Economically, Spiritually, Traditionally
                This is a very sensitive issue; Ital but I-RASMAG is here to point out all the differences about Rastafari diet. Rastas, anti-Rastas, those willing to learn and those who already know, it’s time to strengthen and teach others, I mean I n I can’t dwell on rabbit food forever, I am sure there are some hidden or un-noticed recipes due to oppression but I-RASMAG has an opening to all idres and sistrens fi com and share ideas in the kitchen

                <p>Ganja takes six to nine months to grow but the new ganja takes only six weeks to grow and it’s ready,to grow it,it takes all kinds of chemicals pon it so when everybody like that smell,which is poison.We was iditating for ganja to be legalised not
                decriminalise cos if they decriminalise all Rastas would get it and smoke it cos they have stoned ticket and the big man(supplier and government) him go get shipment,medical,scientific call it this and that,I don’t do all that.I don’t do such things.Herb is just anoher vegetable to I.I don’t see any supreme to any other  herb.DID HAILE SELASSIE I SMOKE?

            <p>
                In 1930’s in America and the surrounding countries started a campaign about marijuana
                Harry J Anslineger would shape Americans attitude towards marijuana for generations to come.He believed that if laws was tough 
                enough,America could get rid of alcohol,put people in jail so that the public could learn to behave.He applied the same philosophy on drugs  
                He was the first commissioner of the federal bureau of narcotics and the first architect of drug war including 
                cannabis.He called the idea that marijuana made people mad or violent ‘’absurd fallacy’’.His influence played a very big role in introduction and passage of the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 which outlawed possessing or selling of marijuana
