            <b>WORDS MADE FAMOUS BY THE GREAT BOB MARLEY (RASTAFARI MESSENGER)</b>
                 <p>Until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another inferior is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned; that there are no longer first class and second class citizens of any nation; that until the colour of a man’s skin is of no more significance than colour of his eyes; that until the basic rights are guaranteed to all without regard to race; that until that day.

            <div class="stanza">
		<p>		 
					 The dream of everlasting peace and world citizenship and the rule of international morality will remain but a fleeting illusion to be pursued but never attained. And until the ignoble but unhappy regimes that holds our brothers in Angola, in Mozambique and in South Africa subhuman bondage have been toppled and destroyed; Until bigotry and prejudice and malicious and inhuman self-interest have been replaced by understanding and goodwill; until all Africans stand and speak as free human beings, equal in the eyes of the Almighty; until that day, the African continent shall not know peace. 
						</p>

            <div class="stanza">
		<p>
			We Africans will fight, if necessary and we are confident in victory of good over evil
                These words were made famous by the Light of Haile Selassie,king of reggae.Bob Marley and the Wailer’s in their song’’WAR’’.The speech was first made by Haile Selassie in 1963 and ALL mentioned three African states were not free and independent but today in 1994 they are all free and independent.
